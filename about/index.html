        <p class="lead">
          My name is Kevin, and I'm here to help <strong>YOU</strong> with your web projects.
          <br>
          I have been doing web development for the past years first at <a href="http://www.novelys.com">Novelys</a>,
          and since a few months on my own.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Why work with me?
        </h4>

        <p class="lead">
          I believe in communication and interactions. I will not work <strong><em>for</em></strong> you, but <strong><em>with</em></strong> you: I begin a project by listening and learning â€” not showing you pictures.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          I want to know about your company, your project, your customers, so that I know the best way to help you. Next, we put together a solid plan and start working towards your goals.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          I strive for simplicity ("things should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler") and adequacy - using the right tools to solve the right problems.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Who have you worked with?
        </h4>

        <p class="lead">
          Before being on my own, I was working at <a href="http://www.novelys.com/portfolio">Novelys</a>.
          I have been involved in most of the projects at Novelys since 2011, sometimes only for maintenance, sometimes as lead developer.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Since then, I have been working with <a href="/projects/deliver.ee">deliver.ee</a>, <a href="/projects/jenvoie-du-lourd">J'envoie du lourd</a>, and the team at <a href="/projects/scalingo">Scalingo</a>.
