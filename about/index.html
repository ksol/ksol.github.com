        <p class="lead">
          My name is Kevin, and I'm here to help <strong>YOU</strong> with your web projects.
          <br>
          I have been doing web development for the past years first at <a href="http://www.novelys.com">Novelys</a>,
          and since a few months on my own.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Why work with me?
        </h4>

        <p class="lead">
          I believe in communication and interactions. I will not work <strong><em>for</em></strong> you, but <strong><em>with</em></strong> you: I begin a project by listening and learning — not showing you pictures.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          I want to know about your company, your project, your customers, so that I know the best way to help you. Next, we put together a solid plan and start working towards your goals.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          I strive for simplicity ("things should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler") and adequacy - using the right tools to solve the right problems.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Who have you worked with?
        </h4>

        <p class="lead">
          Before being on my own, I was working at <a href="http://www.novelys.com/portfolio">Novelys</a>.
          I have been involved in most of the projects at Novelys since 2011, sometimes only for maintenance, sometimes as lead developer.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Since then, I have been working with <a href="http://www.deliver.ee">deliver.ee</a>.
          Their product allows businesses to deliver packages the same-day without having to manage directly the carriers.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="lead">
          At the beginning of September, <a href="mailto:contact@deliver.ee">Sébastien</a> was looking for someone that could help with a set of three web applications: they had a deadline that could not be missed and were understaffed. The applications are made with [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) and consuming a common API (made with Ruby on Rails). One is meant to be used by the businesses, one by the deliver.ee team, and the last one by the carriers.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          I started working on the project under the guidance of another developper and took over as lead developper once he was no longer available. After a few weeks of work the deadline was respected, and since then I'm maintaining the applications, integrating new features, fixing undesired behaviours, and helping Sébastien learn his way around Ember.js and the code bases.
