          <a href="http://www.deliver.ee">deliver.ee</a> is a french start-up whose goal is to make deliveries as easy as possible. They allow businesses to offer their clients same-day delivery for instance, but anybody can use the service and do one-off deliveries, all of this without having to care about the carriers.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          The service revolves around a core API (made with Ruby on Rails) and several web-applications. At the beginning of September, <a href="mailto:contact@deliver.ee">Sébastien</a> (CTO of deliver.ee) was looking for someone that could help him finish some of those applications before an important deadline.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          Three applications were concerned: "cockpit", the one used by the team to monitor and handle everything, "pro", the one used by businesses to order deliveries and follow them, and "carrier", the one used by the carriers to receive delivery orders, follow them, update them, and so on.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          The applications are made with <a href="http://www.emberjs.com">ember.js</a>. I started working on the project under the guidance of another developper and took over as lead developper once he was no longer available.
          <br>
          There was many challenges: we needed to be quick to develop features, but also sharing as many code as possible across the three web applications, staying up to date with ember.js and an ecosystem (ember data, ember-cli, internationalization) that was changing quickly, but in the end we managed to overcome most, if not all of them.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          After a few weeks of work the deadline was respected, and since then I was involved in maintaining the applications, integrating new features, fixing undesired behaviours, and helping Sébastien learn his way around Ember.js and the different code bases.
