          Ember.js defines itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          It aims to solve the same problem as other javascripts frameworks (such as angular.js, backbone.js, etc): making web applications feel like native software.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          Some websites built with Ember: <a href="http://help.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch User Guide</a>, <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a>. Companies like <a href="www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> are known to use Ember in projects (mostly internal ones).

          Ember brings to the javascript ecosystem what <a href="/freelancer/ruby-on-rails" title="Ruby on Rails expert">Ruby on Rails</a> brought many years ago: it's built for productivity, designed with developer ergonomics in mind, and therefore helps to get the job done, and done fast.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          Moreover, the team behind the framework commited to <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15" title="Ember.js 2.0 design">stability without stagnation</a>. This means maintenance will be eased as much as possible (no big application rewrite at each update), without having to sacrifice new features.

          I have been developing with Ember.js since the first versions and have used it in many projects, from internal prototypes to offline web applications.

        <p class="project-content">
          Recently, I've worked with <a href="/projects/deliver.ee">deliver.ee</a> and helped them kick-start their project. Then, I helped <a href="/projects/scalingo">Scalingo</a> transition their aging Ember.js application to actual standards: ember-cli, latest ember versions, best practices, while making sure future updates will be seamless.
