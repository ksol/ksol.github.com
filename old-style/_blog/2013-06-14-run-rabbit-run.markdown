title: Finding balance.

Today, I realized (well, 'remember' would be more accurate) that most of the
things we do in our life can be summed up this way : we spend half the time
cleaning the mess our past selves have left us with, and the other half trying
to make life easier for our future selves. I thought about this while running
and trying to lose all the weight I accumulated over the years, not really
caring about my health or my comfort.

Then it echoed to me that I read an article some time ago, who stated that while
you maybe alone working on a project, there's in reality three persons involved:
past you, current you, and future you, and refered to the situation explained
earlier.

I think it applies in lots of other areas of our lives: relationships, daily
tasks, and others I can't think of right now. Well, it's not really a half-half
situation, you probably also enjoy the present moment for what it is (maybe not
if talking about chores, though).

The problems come when you lose the balance, and spend either too much time
correcting mistakes of the past, or worrying too much about the future, or only
focusing about the present and sticking your head in the sand to forget about everything else.
This is how I've handled my overweight for all my life. First I was telling
myself I would deal with it later, then I was borderline obsessing over it,
but without never really doing something about it. Until a few months ago.

The thing is, I didn't start taking care of myself because I suddenly became
aware that oh shit, I'm gonna die younger than I could, or something like that.
It's not that I do not care about my health, it's just that I do not care *that
much*. What I care about though, is my comfort and my ego.

And so, when I was in Stockholm last november, I had to run for about five
minutes to catch my train. I really felt like shit after that small run. I was
breathing hard and sweating for way too long. And I took it badly, because
while I knew I wasn't good at this, I did not expect to suck that bad.

So forward to now, a bit more than 6 months later. While I'm still not running
half-marathons and whatnot, I am in better shape, and simply knowing it makes
me feel very good. Everything else, as knowing that if I don't fuck up
somewhere along the line I will probably live longer, or finding clothes that
fit me more easily, is bonus. I feel better about myself than I ever did, and
day-to-day life is easier and more enjoyable (and there is my ego and my
comfort).

The best part is that I enjoy eating food that is good for me (or at least,
supposed to be, because everybody is saying different things on that matter...),
and I'm having a blast taking long walks, running, cycling, or other things
involving moving my ass from my couch.

All this to say, life is about finding balance, and keeping it over the time.
Don't waste too much time cleaning after what your past left you. Don't worry
and plan the future too much. Do those things, but with measure, and remember
that "Now" does matter, too.
